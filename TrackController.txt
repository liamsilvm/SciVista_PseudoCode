METHOD OnStateChange:
    - Ready the track
    - If playing, update capture points
    - Update track dimensions and height
    - Draw track based on selected mode

METHOD Activate:
    - If track is ready, trigger OnStateChange
    - Return success/failure

METHOD GetCapturePointsLabels: return capturePointsLabels
METHOD GetCapturePoints: return capturePoints
METHOD GetTrackPoints: return trackPoints
METHOD GetTrackPointsLength: return length of trackPoints
METHOD GetNewTrackPosition: return trackPoints[trackIndex]
METHOD GetTrackIndexVertex(index): clamp and return trackPoints[index]

METHOD UpdateCapturePoints:
    - Initialize arrays
    - Determine increment and calculate each capture point
    - Assign label and position to each capture point

METHOD SetTrack(newTrack): set the track reference
METHOD UpdateTrack: toggle lineRenderer visibility
METHOD GetNumberOfCapturePoints: return numberOfCapturePoints

METHOD UpdateTrackDimensions:
    - If using dataset size, calculate new scale with padding
    - Else, scale by trackRadius
    - Redraw lines

METHOD SetTrackHeight:
    - Add height offset to parent position based on trackheight

METHOD UpdateLineRendererCapturePoints:
    - Ensure points are visible if enabled
    - Create or update capture point GameObjects
    - Set their positions, scale, look direction, and label

METHOD DrawGizmoCapturePoints:
    - For each
